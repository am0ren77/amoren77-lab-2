(b) The database consists of a Plays table and separate tables for the plays Hamlet, Macbeth, and Romeo and Juliet. 
The Plays table holds basic information about each play, including a unique play_id and title. 
The play-specific tables (e.g., hamlet, macbeth, romeo_juliet) store the dialogue, character names, acts, scenes, and line numbers for each play.
Each play-specific table links back to the Plays table via the play_id, establishing a one-to-many relationship where each play can have multiple lines of dialogue or stage directions. 

(c) A key mapping challenge was the presence of duplicates in almost every column, such as dialogue, character names, etc., making it difficult to establish primary or unique keys.
Repeated lines of dialogue by different characters and stage directions without unique identifiers complicated the use of constraints to ensure data integrity. 
Handling NULL values, especially for stage directions that lack line numbers, made it difficult, as NULL values are not allowed in primary keys. 

(d) - Find all scenes where multiple characters speak the same dialogue.
    - Identify the character with the most dialogue in a given play.
    - Find the longest continuous conversation between two characters.
